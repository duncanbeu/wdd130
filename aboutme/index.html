        <h2>Duncan Beutler</h2>
        <h2>People like to call me Duncan</h2>
        <p>I'm a Web Design and Development major from Mapleton Utah, 
            I previously worked in backend development for four years so I'm excited to get into more Full Stack development.
            My end goal is to eventually get a degree in Law, so I'll be applying to Law School upon graduation but expect to work more in software while completing my degree.
        <p>
        <p>Software is a great field to be in as developers are extremely sought after and the field gives you a great deal of autonomy.
            Looking forward to a great semester with you guys!
